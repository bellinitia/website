About
I'm a postdoctoral researcher working at the intersection of comparative literature, cognitive science, and computer science. Currently, I hold dual positions at the [Université de Technologie de Compiègne - Sorbonne Alliance Université](https://costech.utc.fr/membres/bellini-mattia) as a Postdoctoral Researcher, where I work on narrative design for augmented reality experiences in Holocaust museums, and at the [University of Tartu](https://ut.ee/en/employee/mattia-bellini) where I am managing two Knowledge Transfer Projects.

My research explores how interactive digital narratives (particularly video games and mixed reality experiences) can represent and communicate complexity. I'm interested in understanding how narrative  shapes cognition and vice versa, and how we can harness these insights for social good, from science communication to supporting democracy.​

I lead and participate in several European research networks, including serving as Advisory Board Coordinator for the COST Action SiDNet (Science in Diplomacy Network) and as a member of expert boards advising the European Commission on investment policies regarding AI and Digital Technologies. I'm also actively involved with the Association for Research in Digital Interactive Narratives and the International Comparative Literature Association.​

Beyond academic research, I'm passionate about making scholarship accessible and relevant. I've organized international conferences and high-profile stakeholder events bringing together researchers, policymakers, and industry representatives from organizations like the World Economic Forum and UN agencies. I have experience in curating art exhibitions and I also create interactive art myself: my VR work has been exhibited internationally, including during Tartu's year as European Capital of Culture.​

I am a decent cook and an amateur singer, constantly trying not to kill my plants 🌱
